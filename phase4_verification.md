### 📋 Deployment Instructions

#### Single Agent Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn aiohttp websockets

# Start API server (includes agent service)
python phase4_api_server.py

# Test with client
python test_phase4_api.py
```

#### API Usage Examples
```python
# Start agent
POST /agent/start
→ {"success": true, "data": {"agent_id": "agent_xyz"}}

# Submit feedback  
POST /feedback/submit
{
  "feedback_type": "decision_approval",
  "sentiment": "positive", 
  "content": "Excellent decision!",
  "rating": 4.5
}

# Query memory
POST /memory/query
{"query": "What was my last decision?"}
→ Decision explanation with context and reasoning

# WebSocket streaming
WS /stream/events
→ Real-time: {"event_type": "meta_decision", "data": {...}}
```

## 🔒 PHASE 1 CODING AUTHORIZATION

**Prerequisites Met**: YES ✅
**Design Grounding**: SOLID ✅  
**Architecture Clarity**: ESTABLISHED ✅
**Resource Planning**: DOCUMENTED ✅

## 🚦 NEXT STEPS (Phase 1 Entry)

**BEFORE** writing any training code:
1. Install PyTorch with CUDA support
2. Verify GPU memory allocation works  
3. Set up SQLite database with schema
4. Create minimal toy dataset

**THEN** proceed with Phase 1 components:
1. Memory & Knowledge Base (SQLite implementation)
2. Base Learner (1-layer transformer from scratch)
3. Introspection hooks (logging system)  
4. Simple self-update mechanism

## 🧠 RECURSIVE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLE SATISFIED

By completing Phase 0 properly, we have:
- **Avoided blind coding** that leads to architectural confusion
- **Established clear boundaries** for each component's responsibility  
- **Defined success criteria** before implementation begins
- **Created a foundation** that can be referenced throughout development
- **Planned for hardware constraints** rather than discovering them during training

The agent can now **inspect its own architecture** because we've explicitly documented what that architecture should be.
